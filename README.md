# FeedbackForm
Usabilla Customization Test

**CSS:** I chose to use SASS as the pre-processor for my css. The checkboxes, radio buttons and submit button were implemented using CSS Image Sprites.

**HTML:** In order to make the form responsive I had to add the viewport meta tag to the HTML head. I also couldn’t resist adding a title and sub-title to the form for design purposes. The changes I did make to the html code are wrapped in comments: 
<!— Added by Evelyn —> … <!— End added by Evelyn —>

**JS:** The script file contains basic validations for the form. It validates required fields and checks the email field against a regex.

My workflow involved creating a quick mockup in Photoshop before beginning to actually style the form. Let me know if you’d like to see the mockups :)
